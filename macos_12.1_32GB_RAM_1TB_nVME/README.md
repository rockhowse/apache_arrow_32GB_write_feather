# MacOS X 12.1 (Monterey)

This is a standard Macbook laptop with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of nVME disk available. *important* as the testing makes extensive us of SWAP!

## Usage

We are going to run the script `../src/test_32GB_write_feather.R` in RStudio. Ideally this should be done via command line for any automated testing.

## Run 1

The first run has no files created and was done after a reboot so RAM and SWP are nice and clean. 

PRE:     06GB RAM,  00GB SWP, ~00GB fakeFile.csv, ~00GB fakeFile.feather
FWRITE:  16GB RAM,  04GB SWP, ~44GB fakeFile.csv, ~00GB fakeFile.feather
FEATHER: 16GB RAM,  21GB SWP, ~44GB fakeFile.csv, ~15GB fakeFile.feather
POST:    16GB RAM, 0.5GB SWP, ~44GB fakeFile.csv, ~15GB fakeFile.feather

When writing the feather file, 20+GB of SWP was allocated =*( good thing we hvae an nVME drive. 

## run 2 

The second run was done after a reboot of the OS to clear out RAM and SWP to make sure the completion wasn't just a fluke. Also to compare created file sizes. 

PRE:     06GB RAM,  00GB SWP, ~00GB fakeFile.csv, ~00GB fakeFile.feather
FWRITE:  16GB RAM,  04GB SWP, ~44GB fakeFile.csv, ~00GB fakeFile.feather
FEATHER: 14GB RAM,  32GB SWP, ~44GB fakeFile.csv, ~15GB fakeFile.feather
POST:    16GB RAM, 0.7GB SWP, ~44GB fakeFile.csv, ~15GB fakeFile.feather

## file output size compare

Both runs seem to have created files of the exact same size.
